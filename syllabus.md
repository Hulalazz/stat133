### About this course

This course focuses on how to use the computer (and statistical software) to 
conduct a statistical analysis of data. The goal of this course is to introduce 
you to a variety of programs and technologies that are useful for acquiring, 
cleaning, manipulating, organizing, exploring, visualizing, and analyzing data, 
as well as reporting findings. 

We'll begin with an overview of the R language, which you will use extensively 
throughout this course. Then we'll move on to other useful tools, including 
working with regular expressions, basic UNIX tools, XML, and SQL. Because this 
course is so computer­ oriented, it's very important that you take the time 
outside of class to learn by doing---to explore the software we'll be talking 
about in class, and to try out your skills on real datasets in the homework 
assignments and individual project.

- 20% homework
- 10% midterm project
- 25% final project

### Pop Quiz policy

- There will be (between 4 and 5) written pop quizzes during lab 
- I will drop the lowest quiz score
- No makeup quizzes (no exceptions)


### Project Policy

- There will be two projects: one midterm and one final

- Meeting all requirements gives you a B (90% of the project), 
but does not guarantee an A
- We are expecting that you add value and personal touch to each project


### Attendance Policy

- You are expected to attend all lab discussions.
- Cell phones are to be turned off during lectures and labs.
- Any cell phone activity will cause you to lose participation points.


### Submission of assignments

Assignments, both homework and individual projects, will be accepted by electronic submission to the designated location. No late submissions will be accepted. Changes to this policy are possible only by prior arrangement with the instructor in person.


### <a name="email-policy"></a>Email Policy

- You should only use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if Office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- Email sent for any other reason will NOT be considered or acknowledge.
- Do NOT expect me to reply right away (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- Our conversations should take place in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.


### Academic Honest Policy

Homework and projects must be done independently. You may discuss the HW with other students, but you must independently write your code and solutions. For example, suggesting a function to another student is acceptable, whereas simply giving him or her your own code is not. If you are not clear about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking an exam, be sure to seek clarification from the instructor or GSI beforehand.

For exams, cheating includes, but is not limited to, bringing written or electronic materials into an exam or quiz, using written or electronic materials during an exam or quiz, copying off another person's exam or quiz, allowing someone to copy off of your exam or quiz, and having someone take an exam or quiz for you. Any evidence of cheating will result in a minimum penalty of a score of zero (0) on the assignment or examination. Depending on the severity of the infraction, cheating may result in an F for the course grade.


### Disability

If you need accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, please speak to me after class or during office hours. Please make arrangements in a timely manner (through DSP) so that I can make the appropriate accommodations.
